Install
==========================================

|

First of all, make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher:

::

    $ python3.9 --version                                                                                                ─╯
    Python 3.9.4+

Okay! Let's create a folder for your new project. We will also
create a virtual environment. Don't forget to activate your environment:

::

    $ mkdir <new-folder-name> && cd <new-folder-name>                                                                                                ─╯
    $ python3.9 -m venv env
    $ source env/bin/activate

Now we are ready to install the dependency from PyPI.

::

    $ pip install online_packing
