### External Usage Dependencies

* [Python-MIP](https://www.python-mip.com/)
* [Google ORTools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)


<br />

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation

First, check that you have Python 3.9+:
```
python3 --version
```

 Then, you can install the library with the following command:

```sh
pip install fast-online-packing
```


<br />

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://dbeyda.github.io/fast-online-packing/)_


<br />

<!-- Further Development -->
## Further Development / Contributing

Clone the repo somewhere inside your project:
```
git clone https://github.com/dbeyda/fast-online-packing
```

Install development dependencies:
```
pip install -r fast-online-learning/requirements.txt
```

Install the cloned repo using the `--editable` option:
```
pip install -e <path/to/fast-online-packing>
```

Develop, develop, develop. When you're finished, make to update and run the **tests**, and update and generate new **docs**. 

<br />

### Tests
Tests were developed using [PyTest](https://pytest.org/). There is one test for each module, all located under the `tests/` folder.

To run all tests, use the following command:
```
pytest .
```

If you want to output the test log to a file, you can do:
```
pytest . > file.txt
```

<br />

### Generating New Documentation

Documentation is provided in the HTML format and was generated with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). API reference was generated automatically with [autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) from _docstrings_. Documentation source files are found in the `docs_src` folder.

To generate new documentation:
```
cd docs_src
make html
```

Sphinx will read the `.rst` files in `docs_src/` to generate new HTML files in the `docs/` folder.
